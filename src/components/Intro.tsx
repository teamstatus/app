			About <AsHeadline>teamstatus.space</AsHeadline>
		</h1>
		<p>
			<AsHeadline>teamstatus.space</AsHeadline> allows distributed teams collect
			project status updates asynchronously and distributed to speed up their
			sync meetings.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is made by <a href="https://coderbyheart.com/">Markus Tacker</a>, in
			Norway.
		</p>
		<p>
			You use <AsHeadline>teamstatus.space</AsHeadline> to track what you are
			working on, as it happens. It may be small updates, or big releases.
		</p>
		<p>
			Status updates are associated with projects, which belong to
			organizations.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can invite coworkers to the projects you are working on. They then can
			also add their own status to the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			Team members can see status, and add reactions. They are an important tool
			to share praise <OpenmojiIcon emoji="ðŸŒŸ" />, but also prepare the next
			sync meeting. Status can be marked as significant{' '}
			<OpenmojiIcon emoji="ðŸš€" />, so they will be highlighted in the next sync.
			Or a status can be marked as a question <OpenmojiIcon emoji="ðŸ™‹" /> so
			they can be discussed during the sync.
		</p>
		<p>
			And when it's time for a sync meeting with your collaborators, you create
			a new sync which collects all the status updates from the projects your
			meeting is about, from all the collaborators and a time frame you can
			specify.
		</p>
		<p>
			This way you do not have to remember all the big and small things that
			happened since your last sync with this team; or the other group of
			stakeholders you only meet every other week.
		</p>
		<p>
			And since you can share what happened in advance, you can spend your time
			during the meeting to discuss the highlights and the open question which
			<a

				target="_blank"
				rel="me friend met noreferrer noopener"
			>
				ensures that everyone's time is used most efficiently
			</a>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, in order to share your first status, let's create an organization for
			you. Head over to{' '}

				organizations

			to get started.
