		<h2>What is teamstatus.space?</h2>
		<p>
			Teamstatus.space allows distributed teams to collect status updates and
			collect them for a sync meeting.
		</p>
		<p>
			You use teamstatus.space to track what you are working on, as it happens.
			It may be small updates, or big releases.
		</p>
		<p>
			Status updates are associated to projects, which belong to organizations.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can invite coworkers to the projects you are working on. They than can
			also add their own status to the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			And when it's time for a sync meeting with your collaborators, you create
			a new sync which collect all the status updates from the projects your
			meeting is about, from all the collaborators and a time frame you can
			specify. Sync are saved and can be revisited later again.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, in order to share your first status, let's create an account for you.
			Request a PIN for your email in order to sign-up.
