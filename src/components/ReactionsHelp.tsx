						Reactions are a way to add annotations to a status. Besides simple

						reactions can have two special roles:

						<li>
							<Role role={ReactionRole.SIGNIFICANT} />
							Significant: this makes the status stand out, and in syncs will
							highlight the status to make it stand out from regular status.
						</li>
						<li>
							<Role role={ReactionRole.QUESTION} /> Question: signals that this
							status should be discussed during the sync meeting.
						</li>
